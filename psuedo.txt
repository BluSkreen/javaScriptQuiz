console.log(questions[0].answer);

subtract time when answer is wrong and you can make your own starting time for the quiz
have atleast 5 questions up to 10-15

any topic for the questions 

start with just 2 questions and maybe 
and answers like abcd until you figure out the functions and then add more stuff to it

make a hide class and css is it to display none
and then make a function to take it away from being hidden

focus on the timer of this quiz LAST make sure literally everthing else works then go to it and maybe get local storage to work after the timer function
